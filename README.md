<p><strong>IRIS Data Set Analysis Using Python.</strong><br>
<strong>About the Dataset.</strong><br>
The Iris flower data set or Fisherâ€™s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper, The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, as an example of linear discriminant analysis.<br>
The Dataset consist of three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.<br>
The columns in this dataset are:<br>
Id<br>
SepalLengthCm<br>
SepalWidthCm<br>
PetalLengthCm<br>
PetalWidthCm<br>
Species<br>

<p>Entire Analysis is divided into different sections as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Preprocessing</li>
<li>Data Summarizing</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Applying Different Algorithms to fit the Training Data and predict the Test Data.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-preprocessing-">Data Preprocessing:-</h2>
<p>In this section below libraries/ Input Data Sets are imported/Loaded<br>
Panda<br>
Numpy<br>
Seaborn<br>
Matplotlib</p>
<h2 id="summarize-the-dataset">Summarize the Dataset</h2>
<p>In this section we are going to take a look at the data a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dimensions of the dataset.</li>
<li>Peek at the data itself.</li>
<li>Statistical summary of all attributes.</li>
<li>Breakdown of the data by the class variable.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
<p>In this section we visualize the data by using the Univariate and Multivariate plots.</p>
<ol>
<li>Univariate plots to better understand each attribute.</li>
<li>Multivariate plots to better understand the relationships between attributes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="univariate-plots">Univariate plots</h3>
<p>Box and whisker plots and Histograms - This gives us a much clearer idea of the distribution of the input attributes</p>
<h3 id="multivariate-plots">Multivariate plots</h3>
<p>This will be helpful to spot structured relationships between input variables.<br>
Scatter Plot Matrix - This suggests a high correlation and a predictable relationship.</p>
<h2 id="applying-algorithms">Applying Algorithms</h2>
<p>Applied different Algorithms to train the model and predict the data set.<br>
Decision Tree Algorithm gave the best result.</p>
